Since I am deciding to use the shared data in the course,
then the problem tries to measure the severity of an accident due to weather conditions
and the road where a certain journey will be made.

All collisions provided by SPD and recorded by Traffic Records. 
This includes all types of collisions. 
Collisions will display at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. 
Timeframe: 2004 to Present.
